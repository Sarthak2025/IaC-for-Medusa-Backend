Medusa Headless Commerce Backend Deployment with Terraform, AWS ECS/Fargate, and GitHub Actions
This repository demonstrates how to deploy the Medusa headless commerce platform backend using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) on AWS ECS Fargate, along with a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Project Overview
The Medusa backend is deployed as a container on AWS using ECS with Fargate, making it scalable and serverless. The project leverages Terraform to automate the creation of the necessary cloud infrastructure, and GitHub Actions to automate the build, push, and deployment processes.

Architecture
AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate is used for container orchestration.
AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is used to store the Docker images of the Medusa backend.
Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used to distribute traffic to the ECS service.
Terraform is used to provision all AWS infrastructure (VPC, subnets, ECS, load balancer, security groups).
GitHub Actions is used to automate the build and deployment pipeline.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to deploy the Medusa headless commerce platform backend on AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions. It automates both the infrastructure provisioning and the deployment process, making it scalable and easily manageable. Feel free to fork this repository and customize it for your own deployment needs.
